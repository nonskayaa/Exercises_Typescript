    Things to cover:

        1. Basic typing.
        2. Refining types.
        3. Union types.
        4. Merged types.
        5. Generics.
        6. Type declarations.
        7. Module augmentation.
        8. Advanced type mapping.

    Rules and principles:

        1. Avoid using "any" type at all costs.
        2. Difficulty quickly grows one exercise after another.
        3. Enjoy.

Intro:

    We are starting a small community of users. For performance
    reasons we have decided to store all users right in the code.
    This way we can provide our developers with more
    user-interaction opportunities. With user-related data, at least.
    All the GDPR-related issues will be solved some other day.
    This would be the basis for our future experiments during
    these exercises.

Exercise:

    Given the data, define the interface "User" and use it accordingly.

export type User = {
  name: string;

    age: 25,
    occupation: "Chimney sweep",
  },
  {

    age: 23,
    occupation: "Astronaut",
  },
];

export function logPerson(user: User) :void {
  console.log(` - ${user.name}, ${user.age}`);
}

console.log("Users:");
users.forEach(logPerson);
